This is a VLA. Virtual Learning Assistant is a tool that will aid the students with their studies and will help the instructors track the progress of the students in their studies. 

The objectives of the VLA are the following:
1.	Allows student to set up a to-do list so that they can organize their tasks and they get notified to complete them.

2.	To help students through their studies, instructors could publish external resources, such as YouTube videos to the LMS. Instructors could also add a suggested review/study plan for students to follow before exams and sample tests for practice and review for future exams.

3.	To add a reviews section to the LMS, this way students can know what courses to take and with which instructor. Students can write reviews on courses & instructors and can rate them (scale from 1 star to 5 star). 

4.	Allow students to upload notes to LMS & online resources to allow him/her to organize his work. Add an option to have this content private or public for other students to view)
